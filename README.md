# Rift

Rift is a rewrite of Atomic, one of the biggest projects I've undertaken in the past six months.
However, there were severe flaws with the way the bot was structured, and I deemed it that the best way to fix it was to start anew.

I want to share the simplified JS code for this Discord bot, and anyone can use my code.

These clowns helped me write my bot.
